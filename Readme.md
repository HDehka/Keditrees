# Kedi Trees

Keditree is a platform that enables business entities as well as individuals to invest in tree plantations and benefit carbon credits beside the monetary incentive. Carbon credits issued based on the amount of trees(existence) and the carbon sequestration capacity(effectiveness) are input to keditree DAO that mints tokens. DAO sets a fee in order to ensure there are tokens to be burnt in case of loss in value, ex: wildfire or etc.
Business entities and individuals can obtain a green pass to place their bids. The profile eases any audit requests for businesses in case they are interested in ESG scores.
The investors can trade their tokens on all DEXs and benefit the market dynamics.
